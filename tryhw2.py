# 7.6 Question: What do you notice about training the convnet with/without batch normalization? How does it affect convergence? How does it affect what magnitude of learning rate you can use? Write down any observations from your experiments:
# Adding batch normalization improved the training and test accuracy of the model.
# It also appeared to converge much faster. Increasing the learning rate slightly
# to 0.02 did improve accuracy but beyond that it decreased.
